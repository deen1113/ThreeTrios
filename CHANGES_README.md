We created 3 new interfaces in the model package, IDeck, IGrid, and IGridCell. Without these
new customers of the code would have no idea what we used to represent those objects.
We also created the interface ICardView, to make it easier to understand our 
implementation for our view. Wording was changed in multiple places to be more
specific to customers could understand our code.
