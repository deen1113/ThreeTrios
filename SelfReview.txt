Our experience working with providers showed us how It's important to be able to clearly identify what an issue with their code is and be able
to communicate what we need from them. A lot of our communication was clearing up questions we had about their code because there was a lack of
documentation.

Something we wish we'd done differently is in our design is the way we read our files. The way we read our files was fundamentally different than
our providers and this made it impossible to fully implement our view. This doesn't necessarily mean we did it wrong or that they did it wrong,
its just a difference in our designs that caused us to have to make a compromise which ultimately prevented us from finishing this assignemnt.

What we learned from working with customers is that a lot of the way that we design something is because that is the natural way we think about it.
We learned that the 'natural' design of something is very personal and so we had to make a lot of changes to the way that we return fields,
the types of fields we return, and the way that we handle interfaces. We had to make a lot of changes to the return types. We were also asked
to add getter methods in classes that our code didn't require because the customer wanted to be able to access the fields in a certain way. This
preference of design was something that we didn't expect to run into but we learned that it is important to be able to adapt to the customer's needs.
